# Grant Reflection:

  For my Grant proposal, I decided to dive into the music industry. My project is a website that analyzes Frank Ocean’s reception over-time. I was very interested in doing a project based on music and my meeting with my professor helped me focus and narrow down an artist to do the website on. Narrowing the project down to a specific artist helped place the project in a niche that will be useful for any future research on the subject matter. This at first seemed like it would be difficult for my research when doing my environmental scan, but it actually was helpful when gathering research. It showed me an area that had not really been researched well. When I first wrote my abstract it was too broad and too large, and in the end it was smaller and much more specific, but the resulting idea was still impactful. The only other projects that are similar is a “Blonded.blog” which is exactly what it sounds like. It was mainly a simple blog with many articles. However, it doesn’t really perform the same action as my site. When writing the grant I initially thought the process was more convoluted than it was, but as the process went on it became much more streamlined, and things became clearer. I never knew what an environmental scan was, but after finding out it didn’t seem very necessary in practice. Upon completing the scan it actually helped out tremendously, especially in the process of focusing on what project is exactly doing different from others. Overall, I really enjoyed building the process, it helped me think about all the things that go into the process of creating, designing and building a digital humanities project. 
	
 Definition of digital humanities from the start was never initially clear to me. My initial definition was that digital humanities is a combination of digital arts into some sort of project. However, I currently defined it as computerized data founded from humanities research that is presented in a meaningful way. I think I have a better understanding of the field as a whole in the sense that I understand what it’s actually about. The field is very broad in a way that things can be classified as digital humanities, but the topic of each project is very unique compared to one another. Over the course we’ve had several readings. I enjoyed the more tip and trick oriented ones. Those I think actually helped me as a writer and just gain fast knowledge about some of the topics we’ve had. Such as the articles discussing“ how to write a good grant proposal” and “The best practices for designing a grant project”. Those really helped me gain quick and applicable knowledge to questions I had when working on the material. However, my favorite reading and project was on The Yellow-Wallpaper. I enjoyed reading the original manuscript as well as the accompanying TEI project. The Yellow Wallpaper was a nice relaxing narrative and I enjoyed it because it was different from what we had been doing previously. The TEI project was especially nice because it was synonymous with my major in computer science. For the project we needed to encode parts of the manuscript in XML documents, and showcase special details.

  It introduced me to a new front-end web development language. Another aspect I really liked about the course was GitHub. While I’ve used it in other courses DH was the last course I expected it to appear again. It actually showed me newer ways to use the site aside from pushing and pulling code from repositories.
Overall this process and class as a whole was a nice experience. I enjoyed this course and what it was about after practically going into the course blind.
