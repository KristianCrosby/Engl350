# Review 2 - MoMA: Inventing Abstraction
## Second Story 
### https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?page=home

**Overview:** 
MoMA: Inventing abstraction is a site dedicated to showcasing decadent abstract art pieces from across the world during the early 20th century. Each awesome art piece is curated from a 15-year span ranging from 1910 to 1925. Over this 15 year span, the site collected hundreds of artists and their works. The site recognizes, collects, and eloquently organizes hundreds of artists and their unique artworks into a vast network of interconnected pieces. Often artworks are grouped by artists or by the type of art they are. This allows for people to see similar artworks of the same classification from different artists around the same time period. Truly highlighting an amazing period of abstraction art during its earlier years. 

**Background:**

The site specifically highlights emerging modernist abstract artworks. Abstract art presented itself fairly recently for the time period and at the time it was only just beginning to become modern. These abstract artworks were some of the first of their kind for modernist art as well. The works first appeared around 100 years and several different implications and interpretations. Viewers are able to historic and artistic value from each of these pieces and possibly even connect values to one another.

**Review:**

MoMA: Inventing abstraction provides a fantastic online digital collection of historic pre-modern abstract artworks. The site design itself is also constructed in an elegant modern view and it’s very easy to navigate without the site looking dull or a standard Html-skeleton-like site. Atop the page, there are four sections to click that bring you to different pages of the site. The connections section displays the highlight of the site which is a huge network of lines and connections between each artist. The connections are remarkable at bringing together and organizing the artists and their respective works, where they then classify them and show similar works, by similar artists. They also include an artists page where they have all the artists in alphabetical order that were featured on the connections page, in case you’d like to navigate through a different way. I like that you can scroll through and search through artists in a traditional way as well.

The third page is a section called conversations, which takes you to articles about some artists included in the connections. This feature is pretty cool in case you wanna learn a little more about some of the meaning behind some of the pieces, and gain a bit more insight. Lastly, the page includes programs and events, which are some links on the actual MoMA website that offer exactly that. One of my favorite things about the site is that the works actually vary piece by piece. The site not only collects classical mediums but also other art forms such as printed matter, books, sheets of music, dance, sculpture, books, and even film. Another really cool part is on the bottom of the page there is a network diagram tab that displays the connections like a map and includes a legend. Really nice attention to detail on that part.

**Things I would change:**

There’s very little that I would change. The only small issues about the site I could find were from the connections. Once you click on one, it can be a bit confusing because the whole thing changes each time you want you to visit a new artist, because of the way it works. So you kinda have to be prepared to click back a few times to try and go back or look through in some chronological way. However, they do solve this problem by including that artist’s page that allows you to scroll through the artists and see their works alphabetically. Another minor issue is the programs and events page is extremely outdated. They are essentially linked to events that date as far back as 2013. This is a pretty simple fix as they could simply update the page, or scrap the section altogether. At the bottom of the page, there is also a dead link to an about section, which is a bit disappointing because it seemed like it could offer a bit more about the site.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this site and the project as a whole. As the art itself was very interesting to read, and I can genuinely find myself coming back to this website whether for academic or purely entertainment purposes. Even after the small very fixable issues, the site was still pretty well made and I could tell the site had a lot of purposefully modernist elements that really help the site feel immersive.
