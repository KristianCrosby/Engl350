**Overview:**

Livingstone Online is an expansive amalgamation of a famous victorian explorer David Livingstone. The website greets you with a nice background of a victorian artwork depicting a scene in Livingstone’s manuscripts. My initial first impression while clicking through the site was how expansive the site actually was. Each main page is filled and divided into several other subdivisions of the site, detailing different aspects of that particular subsection. Sources for all information are provided on the top of each page, before each articulated section. The site prides itself on the accessibility to the information and its thousands of transcriptions and detailed manuscripts.

**David Livingstone: Biopic**

David Livingstone is a famous explorer from Blantyre Scotland and is known for his time as a missionary in Africa and as an active abolitionist. As a child, Livingstone would work in unethical conditions at a local factory. He was fortunate enough to have a decent education due to his circumstances and location in Scottland. He was able to use that to his advantage and be able to practice medicine and healthcare by the age of 19. During his further education, Livingstone was inspired by philosophy and religion and set out to become a missionary. During his travels, Livingstone would go onto later become the first European explorer to traverse Africa. Livingstone would later go on to have his travels well documented and published with the help of editors and artists. Documents of David Livingstone’s expeditions across Africa were very well received and his fame would continue after his death into the victorian age. He was remembered for his heroic nature and powerful contributions to geographical explorations. 

**Review/Technology:**

Livingstone Online is an experience that brings an unprecedented amount of information, facts, firsthand manuscripts, and transcriptions to every reader. The site opens up with a victorian era scene presumably from one of Livingstone’s books and has six main clickable points, each of which takes you to atmost nine different clickable sections on each page. The name of the main six sections is an “About” page, “Personal accounts”, “Spectral Imaging”, “Life and Times”, “Behind the scenes”, and a “resources” tab. Within each page, there are several different headings with information under them. On each side, you can then click an arrow to go through each new section. Which I found to be very convenient. The pages are relatively self-explanatory to the content you will receive however you there is a lot of different clickable parts when you click on one of the six main sections so there’s a lot to actually see. The spectral imaging page is an integral part of the project and site itself as it helped decipher tons of information that would have been lost without it. Spectral imaging was described as a cutting edge technology that allows the user to see manuscripts that had been withered away over the years.

**Gripes:** 

The site had no noticeable technology faults and the UI seemed to be very smooth and responsive. The information was easily accessible, however, there was a lot to cover. This makes the site very intimidating and a little confusing due to the fact that it was difficult to pick a point where to start. After exploring the site a while, I found it to be very informative, but some of the information seemed repetitive or unnecessary. I also had trouble trying to find the target audience for this site, It was very well done, however, due to the sheer vastness of info it was difficult trying to find something specific. I would recommend this site as a scholarly source as each page is well documented with citations on the top of them.

**Conclusion:** 

Livingstone Online was generally more interesting than it appears at first glance. It was a very informative read about David Livingstone’s career. And provided richness behind deciphering Livingstone's manuscripts through technology. The only things I would recommend would be to consolidate the information and cut out some of the extraneous parts. This would help establish a target audience that you want the site to be suited for.
